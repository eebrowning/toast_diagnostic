Running the project:

If you already have your local environment set up, just navigate to the next-app folder in your terminal, and run the following:

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

Step 1: Installing the Node JS and NPM

https://brew.sh/ ->go here, there is a copyable terminal script you can paste in your terminal to install Homebrew.

Upon opening Homebrew, you will encounter a command-line interface where you can easily unpack and install Node.js and NPM by executing the command 'brew install node'. After this, Node JS and NPM will be installed, and you have to confirm their Installation.

`brew install node`

Step 2: Verifying Installation
To confirm the Installation of Node JS and NPM, you have to open the terminal and type the node -v and npm -v commands to check the installed version.

`node -v`

`npm -v`

If the Homebrew hasnâ€™t installed the latest version of Node JS, you can open it again and run the command brew upgrade node. It will update the Node JS version.


David: providing variety of useful splunk queries that can be turned into a template for generating splunk links
Gabriel: Front end appearance, next.js structure, Chrome connection 
Ethan: next.js API, data store(react-query or redux), sorting data efficiently

**Gabriel, I do not know how to properly organize a next.js project 0.o' -> feel free to just reorganize as needed! -EB


Rx Info/Integration health check Tool -> support-centered tool for checking for most recent 3pd orders
ideally would help T1/T2 immediately eliminate integrations issues, and to get an idea of how the 'big 3' are functioning at-a-glance.
could be extended to Cx's as a POS button, like the device health checks that currently exist.
Could also provide pre-scripted links to queries w/ splunk -> basically just pasting in the clientID and GUID for the user on queries, sorted by issue (api orders/ loyalty/ gift card)

Ideally should be a Chrome extension.
Could just be a front end app on a free host.

Takes guid like postman, but returns options/useful shortcuts

* Location:Address:GUID: block for partner comms (maybe template button for slack/email outreach)
* Google search link for partners based on address
* Orders api check for 3pd orders-> latest of each; date/time
* Auto toggle first inventory item to re-send webhooks
* Shortcut links to toast web settings pages-> sorted by common settings#rxinfotool

Mock JSON for frontend building
* OrdersBulk is an array of order objects -> make a list of keys in those objects of useful info for the goal: source:API, diningOption: islike(Grubhub, Doordash, uber eats)




Features: 3 tabs?
* Rx Info
* Orders health check
* Helpful splunks


Rx Info:
* general info, should just be a 'copy rx info' button or something to save space
* formatted block for easy pasting to comms to partners: lx name, address, guid


Orders health check:
* Last orders from gh/dd/ue
* https://ws-api.toasttab.com/orders/v2/ordersBulk?startDate=2020-07-13T18:00:00.000-0000&endDate=2020-07-13T22:00:00.000-0000 -> then sort by source, dining option-> dining ops might need to be determined programmatically from JSON
* 

Helpful Splunks:
* Pre-structured queries that will link to splunk
* Categories/issues
